# Postfinance Checkout
Short description and motivation.

## Usage

Add a `transaction_id` field to your orders model:

```bash
rails generate migration AddTransactionIdToOrders transaction_id:string
```

Configure the gem and set the callbacks:

```ruby
Postfinancecheckout.configure do |config|
  config.space_id = 12345
  config.app_user_id = 56789
  config.app_user_key = "my_secret_key"

  config.on_success = -> (transaction_id) do
    order = Order.find_by(transaction_id: transaction_id)
    order.update(status: :paid)

    PaymentSuccessMailer.deliver_later(order)
  end

  config.on_failure = -> (transaction_id) do
    order = Order.find_by(transaction_id: transaction_id)
    order.update(status: :failed)

    PaymentFailedMailer.deliver_later(order)
  end
end
```

Create a transaction and store the transaction ID:

```ruby
transaction = Postfinancecheckout::Transaction.new(
  amount: 34.5,
  order_number: '1234',
  email: 'test@example.com',
  address: {
    first_name: 'Testbenutzer',
    last_name: 'Muster',
    street: 'Hauptstrasse 123',
    post_code: 3019,
    city: 'ChÃ¤s und Brot',
    state: 'BE',
    country_code: 'CH'
  }
)
transaction.save

@order.update(transaction_id: transaction.id)
```

Once you have saved the transaction, generate the payment URL and redirect the user:

```ruby
redirect_to transaction.payment_url
```
